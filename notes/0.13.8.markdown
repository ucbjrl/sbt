### Improvements

- Discovered main classes are now sorted. [#1180][1180] by [@kretes][@kretes]
- Implemented a new mechanism of forking javac, whereby errors are captured.  Also more likely to run in-process. [#1702][1702] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]

## Fixes

- Javac warnings now always treated as warnings.  [#1702][1702]/[#875][875] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]
- compilerReporter now fed to javac during incremental compilation. [#1542][1542] by [@jsuereth][jsuereth]
- ignore hidden build files from the build. [#1746][1746] by [@j-keck][@j-keck]
