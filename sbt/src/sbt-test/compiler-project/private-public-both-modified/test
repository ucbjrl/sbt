# Test for https://github.com/sbt/sbt/issues/2324
# introduces first compile iteration
> compile
# change signature of a private `A.foo` method
$ copy-file changes/A1.scala src/main/scala/A.scala
# it should recompile just A.scala because changes to `A.foo` can't affect B
> compile
# check if there are only two compile iterations performed
